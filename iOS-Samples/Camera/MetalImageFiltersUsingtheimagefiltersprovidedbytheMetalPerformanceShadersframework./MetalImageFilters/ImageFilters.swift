    Abstract:
    Image Filters for MetalImageFilters.
                Each image filter is represented as a class that conforms to the CommandBufferEncodable protocol.
                The protocol ensures that each image filter is initialized with a Metal device and obtains the necessary Metal objects to encode its MetalPerformanceShaders operations.
                The image filters can be single-pass or multi-pass operations on Metal buffers and/or textures.
                The initial source texture is always the original input image read from a file or video.
                The final destination texture is always the filtered output image written to the MTKView's drawable.
