# Metal Image Filters: Using the image filters provided by the Metal Performance Shaders framework.

This sample demonstrates how to use a selection of MPSKernel classes to filter an image on the GPU. The image is processed as a MTLTexture object, obtained from either a bundled file or a real-time video stream. The filters demonstrated range from a single-pass Sobel filter to a multi-pass histogram specification.

## Requirements

### Build

Xcode 8.0 or later; iOS 10.0 SDK or later

### Runtime
